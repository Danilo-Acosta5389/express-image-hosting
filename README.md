# express-image-hosting

Hosting app for images. Written in JS with Node.js and Express.js

In order to run, clone repo and run ```npm install``` in root. Then create a uploads/ folder, or run ```mkdir uploads``` in root, add images in uploads folder to serve.
example url ```http://localhost:3000/uploads/myimage.png```<br/>
In the server.js you can add what filetypes are accepted aswell other configurations such as portnumber. 
There is an upload function that is commented out, it works but i just don't need it yet.

Run the app with ```nodemon server.js``` or ```node server.js```
